Phase 1

➡ Markdown-based human agents driven by Claude Desktop

to

Phase 2+

➡ Autonomous API-powered agents running inside LangGraph, controlled by n8n.

To do this cleanly, you need to understand what LangGraph agents actually are, how they differ from “Claude markdown agents,” and how/when they replace your current human-readable .md protocols.

Below is the clearest explanation possible.

⸻

⭐ What You Have Today: “Claude Markdown Agents”

Right now, your agentic behavior is defined through:
	•	Markdown instruction files (agent persona, guidelines, DO/DON’T, output format)
	•	Claude Desktop interpreting those files
	•	You (or the system) pasting tasks into Claude Code

This is the Claude-native “agent architecture” — simple, flexible, readable.

Pros:
✓ Easy to write
✓ Easy for humans to debug
✓ Great for prototyping
✓ Fully transparent

Cons:
✗ No orchestration
✗ No isolation
✗ No STOP-gates
✗ No state or logging
✗ No deterministic loop control
✗ No multi-agent governance
✗ No reproducibility

This is fine for MVP #1 — but it cannot scale to a governed, multi-agent system.

⸻

⭐ What Comes Next: “LangGraph Agents”

LangGraph has a totally different mental model for agents.

A “LangGraph agent” is not a prompt.
It is not a markdown file.
It is not a persona.

A LangGraph agent is:

A node in a state machine that uses an LLM to transform a state object.

That’s it.

Formally:
	•	Agents = LangGraph nodes
	•	Nodes = pure functions
	•	Functions = (state) → (updated state)
	•	All execution is deterministic, replayable, logged
	•	Nodes can represent AI or non-AI logic

A LangGraph agent looks like this:

async def execution_agent(state):
    prompt = build_prompt_from_protocol(state)
    result = llm.invoke(prompt)
    return { "artifact": result }

And LangGraph handles:
	•	Routing
	•	Loops
	•	STOP-gates
	•	Conditional transitions
	•	Error recovery
	•	Deterministic logs
	•	Node isolation
	•	Multi-agent protocols
	•	State serialization

This is exactly why LangGraph was invented.

⭐ Why LangGraph Agents Matter

Here is the architectural truth:

Claude markdown agents = instructions
LangGraph agents = actual functional components in a machine

Markdown agents:
	•	Live on disk
	•	Are interpreted by Claude Desktop or Claude API
	•	Have no state
	•	Have no lifecycle
	•	Do not enforce structure

LangGraph agents:
	•	Live in a state machine
	•	Are executed under deterministic governance
	•	Have entry/exit phases
	•	Track decisions, loops, errors
	•	Can be supervised, escalated, STOP-gated
	•	Produce reproducible outputs

They are complementary:

Phase 1

Markdown agents → human follows guidelines

Phase 2

LangGraph agents → call Claude API with markdown guidelines embedded

Phase 3

LangGraph agents stop using markdown and instead use modular prompt templates, tools, memory, etc.

⭐ How You Migrate from Markdown → LangGraph Agents

✔ Step 1 — Treat markdown files as “protocols”

You keep:

docs/agents/CODING_AGENT.md
docs/agents/REVIEW_AGENT.md
docs/agents/PM_AGENT.md

These become templates for the LangGraph nodes.

✔ Step 2 — Wrap them in system prompts

Your LangGraph execution agent becomes:

def load_agent_protocol(agent_type):
    with open(f"docs/agents/{agent_type}.md") as f:
        return f.read()

async def execution_node_ai(state):
    protocol = load_agent_protocol("CODING_AGENT")
    task = state["task_description"]

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": protocol},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Task:\n{task}"}
    ]
    response = llm.invoke(messages)

    return { "output": response }

✔ Step 3 — Replace human file-watching with LLM execution

Today:
	•	Human reads .md
	•	Human writes output file

Later:
	•	LangGraph agent reads .md
	•	LangGraph writes output .md

✔ Step 4 — n8n wraps execution

n8n then:
	•	Calls LangGraph via CLI
	•	Runs STOP-gates
	•	Enforces loop limits
	•	Handles files
	•	Triggers Claude Code

Exactly as planned.

⭐ The Key Architectural Insight

LangGraph is your execution engine.
n8n is your orchestrator.
Claude markdown files are your agent protocols.
Claude API is the compute engine behind each agent.

Mapping:

Concept	Today	Future
Agent Behavior	Markdown protocol	LangGraph node using protocol
Execution	Human	Claude API
Orchestration	None	n8n
STOP-gates	None	n8n + LangGraph
Escalation	None	Supervisor agent
Logging	Git + text	Structured state logs
State	Files	LangGraph state machine
Loop control	Human judgement	LangGraph conditional edges

This architecture is clean, powerful, and upgradable.

⭐ Final Answer — What Are LangGraph Agents?

A LangGraph “agent” is:

A node inside a deterministic state-machine that encapsulates an LLM-powered behavior, defined by a protocol, executed with explicit inputs and outputs, controlled by routing logic, and orchestrated externally by tools like n8n.

They are not just prompts.
They are not just markdown.
They are functional state-machine components.

Markdown is just the blueprint the agent uses.
